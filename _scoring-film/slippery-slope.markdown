We are also here in the musical, probably the first debate musical in the world. The evening modestly calls itself "a piece with songs". But the songs are not accessories, but constitutive. The spoken text and the song text merge artistically into one another. The lyrics don't slow things down, but summarize and comment - like the entire text in English, the world language of musicals. - [Winning the prestigious award Berliner Theatertreffen ](https://www.berlinerfestspiele.de/de/berliner-festspiele/programm/bfs-gesamtprogramm/programmdetail_379221.html)
