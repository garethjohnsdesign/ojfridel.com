USER NOT FOUND is about our digital lives after we die. A new production created by pioneering theatre company Dante Or Die Theatre in collaboration with writer Chris Goode, digital design company Marmelo and musician/Sound designer Yaniv Fridel.  After the performance we would offer to do a Q&A and opportunities to follow up at the end of the show.

 

Dante or Die makes bold and ambitious site-specific performances that tour across the country and internationally. they gently transform ordinary spaces to create unique and intimate theatrical experiences. Their original productions interrogate and celebrate contemporary human stories that take place in everyday buildings -  from hotel rooms to swimming pools to cafés.
