Info 
The most important thing is to be honest, right? Surely we can talk openly about everything? Or can’t we? But one should know exactly where the line between honesty and harassment lies, what’s appropriate, what one’s allowed to say and what not. Above all, one should know how to find out about all that.

Sexuality has always been complicated: where fantasy and reality, state of emergency and everyday life, desire and fear of being hurt meet, language reaches its limits and beyond the sexual comfort zone it becomes difficult to »talk about it«. And when someone does speak, then it’s often as a catcall on the street, as a comment at work, always following the lines of the patriarchy from top to bottom. But how does the treatment of shame, fear and lust change offline in times of #MeToo’s online revolution?

Sexuality has always been material for the theatre: since it’s just make-believe, all of the things that everyone dreams about but is afraid to say out loud can be played through. In their new devised play, Yael Ronen and her intrepid ensemble take the aftermath of #MeToo personally, facing themselves as victims and as perpetrators. They discuss attacks and abuse, explore desires and boundaries, get to the bottom of their own fears and mindfucks, and search for sincere communication in private parts. Because the first step lies in the interpersonal. And although the theatre loves conflicts, the ensemble dares to attempt something unusual: visions. They investigate new structures and forms of cooperation -- with the audience as well. And where language fails, music begins, with songs specially composed by Israeli superstar and relationship expert Shlomi Shaban.
